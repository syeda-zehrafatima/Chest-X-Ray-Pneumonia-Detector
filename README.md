# Chest-X-Ray-Pneumonia-Detector
This project is a research-oriented Chest X-ray Pneumonia Detector built using PyTorch and Streamlit. It leverages a ResNet18 convolutional neural network to classify chest X-ray images as Normal or Pneumonia. Additionally, it implements Grad-CAM to generate visual heatmaps that highlight areas of the X-ray contributing to the model's prediction.
