# Chest-X-Ray-Pneumonia-Detector

#  Description & Purpose

This project is a research-focused AI system designed to automatically detect Pneumonia from Chest X-ray images. It uses PyTorch, Streamlit, and a fine-tuned ResNet18 CNN model to classify an image as Normal or Pneumonia.
To enhance transparency, the system also generates Grad-CAM heatmaps, helping users visualize which lung areas influenced the model’s prediction.

#  Use Case Notice

This tool is intended for:

Educational demonstrations
